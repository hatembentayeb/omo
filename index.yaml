# OhMyOps Official Plugin Index
# This file is the source of truth for all official plugins.
# The omo package manager fetches this index to discover available plugins.
#
# To add a new plugin:
#   1. Create a new repo under github.com/ohmyops/
#   2. Build the .so for each supported platform
#   3. Create a GitHub release with the .so as an asset
#   4. Add an entry below

api_version: v1

# URL template for downloading plugin binaries.
# {{name}}    → plugin name (e.g. "redis")
# {{version}} → semver (e.g. "0.1.0")
# {{os}}      → runtime.GOOS (e.g. "linux")
# {{arch}}    → runtime.GOARCH (e.g. "amd64")
